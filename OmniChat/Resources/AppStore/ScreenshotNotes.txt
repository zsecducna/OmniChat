3. Take screenshot with Cmd+S
4. Screenshots saved to Desktop

### Device Method (recommended for final):

## Screenshot Naming Convention

Store captured screenshots in this folder with names like:
- `iPhone_6.7_Screenshot1_ConversationList.png`
- `iPhone_6.7_Screenshot2_StreamingChat.png`
- `iPhone_6.7_Screenshot3_CodeBlock.png`
- `iPad_12.9_Screenshot1_SplitView.png`
- `macOS_Screenshot1_FullWindow.png`

---

## App Store Connect Upload

1. Navigate to App Store Connect > App > Screenshots
2. Drag and drop screenshots for each device type
3. App Store Connect will auto-scale if needed (but prefer native sizes)
4. Add localized captions if supporting multiple languages

---

## Screenshot Size Validation

Before uploading, verify dimensions:

```bash
# Check image dimensions
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight screenshot.png

# Batch resize if needed
sips -z 2796 1290 screenshot.png
```

## Marketing Use

The same screenshots can be used for:
- App Store listing
- Website
- Press kit
- Social media (may need different aspect ratios)

Consider creating additional marketing-focused images:
- Feature highlight graphics
- Comparison charts
- Provider logos montage

---

## Notes

- Screenshots can be updated without a new app version
- Test screenshots on various devices in App Store preview
- Consider A/B testing different screenshot sets
- Localized screenshots improve conversion in non-English markets
