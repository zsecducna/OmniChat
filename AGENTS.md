## Blockers

- **TASK-4.1 (MarkdownParser)**: The swift-markdown library (version 0.7.3) has API changes from earlier versions. The `MarkupVisitorResultKind` type no longer exists, and `MarkupVisitor` protocol methods have different signatures. The MarkdownParser.swift file needs to be rewritten to use the current swift-markdown API. This blocks TASK-4.4 (MessageBubble markdown upgrade).

## Integration Notes

- DevOps Agent must complete TASK-0.1 before any other agent can begin
- Core Agent: All provider adapters must conform to AIProvider protocol in ProviderProtocol.swift
- UI Agent: Import models from Core/Data/Models/
- QA Agent: Start writing test infrastructure (mocks, factories) once Phase 1 begins
