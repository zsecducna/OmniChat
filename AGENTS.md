Uses ProviderConfigSnapshot for Sendable adapter creation. Both iOS and macOS builds succeed.
- [2026-02-21] PHASE 1 COMPLETE: All 8 Phase 1 tasks completed. Core data layer (SwiftData models, Keychain), provider abstraction layer (AIProvider protocol, AnthropicAdapter, OpenAIAdapter, ProviderManager), and networking foundation (HTTPClient, SSEParser) are fully implemented. The app can now configure providers, store API keys securely, and stream chat responses from Anthropic Claude and OpenAI. Ready for Phase 2 (Chat UI Foundation).
- [2026-02-21] TASK-1.1 completed: All 6 SwiftData models verified and enhanced. Conversation: lastMessage, messageCount, totalTokens computed properties, touch(), addUsage() helpers. Message: hasAttachments, totalTokens, isUser, isAssistant. Attachment: utType, isImage, fileExtension, fileSize, fileSizeDescription. ProviderConfig: ModelInfo struct (contextWindow, supportsVision, inputTokenCost, outputTokenCost), customHeaders/oauthScopes transient properties, makeSnapshot() for Sendable copy. Persona: defaultPersonas static property with 6 built-in personas (Default, Code Assistant, Writing Editor, Translator, Summarizer, Research Assistant), seedDefaults(into:) method. UsageRecord: totalTokens computed property, FetchDescriptor helpers for date range/provider/conversation queries. Created ProviderConfigSnapshot struct for Sendable conformance (SwiftData @Model cannot be Sendable). Updated AIProvider protocol and adapters (AnthropicAdapter, OpenAIAdapter) to use ProviderConfigSnapshot. Fixed infinite recursion in UsageRecord convenience init. Fixed AnyCodable nil handling in OpenAIAdapter. Both iOS and macOS builds succeed.
- [2026-02-21] TASK-1.7 completed: OpenAIAdapter implemented in Core/Provider/Adapters/OpenAIAdapter.swift. Conforms to AIProvider protocol with full streaming support via SSE. Implements OpenAI Chat Completions API (POST /v1/chat/completions) with headers: Authorization: Bearer <key>, Content-Type. Parses SSE data: events for choices[0].delta.content. Vision support via image_url content blocks with base64 data URLs. fetchModels() calls GET /v1/models and filters for chat-capable models (gpt-*). Model metadata includes context windows (128K for GPT-4o/o1, 8K for GPT-4), vision support flags, and per-token costs. Uses AnyCodable helper for encoding heterogeneous dictionaries. Thread-safe task cancellation via ActiveTaskBox wrapper class. validateCredentials() tests API key against /v1/models endpoint. All types Sendable for Swift 6 compliance.
- [2026-02-21] TASK-1.6 completed: AnthropicAdapter implemented in Core/Provider/Adapters/AnthropicAdapter.swift. Conforms to AIProvider protocol with full streaming support via SSE. Implements Anthropic Messages API (POST /v1/messages) with headers: x-api-key, anthropic-version: 2023-06-01, content-type. Parses SSE events: message_start (input tokens), content_block_delta (text_delta), message_delta (output tokens), message_stop. Vision support via base64 images in content blocks. Known models hardcoded since Anthropic has no /models endpoint (Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet, 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku, 3 Opus/Haiku). validateCredentials() sends minimal request to verify API key. All types Sendable for Swift 6 compliance.
- [2026-02-21] TASK-1.3 completed: AIProvider protocol defined in ProviderProtocol.swift with full documentation. Includes ChatMessage, AttachmentPayload, RequestOptions, StreamEvent types.

## Integration Notes

- DevOps Agent must complete TASK-0.1 before any other agent can begin
- Core Agent: All provider adapters must conform to AIProvider protocol in ProviderProtocol.swift
- UI Agent: Import models from Core/Data/Models/
- QA Agent: Start writing test infrastructure (mocks, factories) once Phase 1 begins
